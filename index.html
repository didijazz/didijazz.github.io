<p><em><strong>Update February 2020:</strong> Due to personal reasons, I am downscaling my teaching, and will no longer be taking on new students for the foreseeable future. As such, the 'Lessons' page on this website has been removed, and I have also removed myself from music teaching directories. If you spotted a music teaching listing that I missed, please <a href="mailto:lessons@didi.com.au" target="_blank">e-mail me</a> so I can remove it!</em></p>
