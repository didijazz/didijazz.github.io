# Down St Thomas Way
One cold winter morning it was 7 below  
I made up my mind "my friend this snow's got to go"  
So I subleased, went south be east  
and freezing seas down St Thomas way  

The people were friendly and they gave me the key  
Attached was a tourist guide as cute as can be  
We climbed the heights, saw all the sights  
Whoa those nights down St Thomas way  

I know how it feels to have some sand in my shoes  
And finally escaped from all these civilized blues  
No cul de sacs, no broken back  
It's just relax down St. Thomas way  

I'm trading the city for a tropical treat  
And if you meet anyone who's asking for me.  
Tell them leech, that they can reach  
Beyond the beach down St. Thomas way.
