# Rainy Night in Georgia (Tony Joe White)

Hoverin' by my suitcase  
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night  
A heavy rains a fallin'  
Seems I hear your voice callin'  
"it's all right"  

A rainy night in Georgia  
A rainy night in Georgia  
I believe, that it's rainin' all over the world  

Neon signs a flashin'  
Taxi cabs, and buses passin' through the night  
The distant moanin' of the train  
Seems to play a sad refrain, to the night  

A rainy night in Georgia  
It's such a rainy night in Georgia  
Lord I believe, that it's rainin' all over the world  

How many times I've wondered  
It still comes out the same  
No matter how you look at it or think of it  
You just got to do your own thing  

I find me a place in a box car  
So I take out my guitar, to pass some time  
Late at night when it's hard to rest  
I hold your picture to my chest  
And I'm alright  

It's a rainy night in Georgia  
Lord it's such a rainy night in Georgia  
It's rainin' all over the world
