# Java Jive
I love coffee, I love tea  
I love the java jive and it loves me  
Coffee and tea and the java and me  
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup (boy!)  

I love java, sweet and hot  
Whoops mr. moto, I'm a coffee pot  
Shoot the pot and I'll pour me a shot  
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup  

Oh slip me a slug from the wonderful mug  
And I'll cut a rug just snug in a jug  
A sliced up onion and a raw one  
Draw one -  
Waiter, waiter, percolator  

I love coffee, I love tea  
I love the java jive and it loves me  
Coffee and tea and the java and me  
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup  

Boston bean (soy beans)  
Green bean (cabbage and greens)  
I'm not keen about a bean  
Unless it is a chili chili bean (boy!)  

I love java sweet and hot  
Whoops mr. moto I'm a coffee pot (yeah)  
Shoot me the pot and I'll pour me a shot  
A cup, a cup, a cup (yeah)  

Slip me a slug of the wonderful mug  
'an I'll cut a rug just as snug in a jug  
Drop a nickel in the pot joe  
Takin' it slow  
Waiter, waiter, percolator  

I love coffee, I love tea  
I love the java jive and it loves me  
Coffee and tea and the java and me  
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, boy!
