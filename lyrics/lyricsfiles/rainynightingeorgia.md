# Rainy Night in Georgia

Hoverin' by my suitcase  
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night  
A heavy rains a fallin'  
Seems I hear your voice callin'  
"all right"  

A rainy night in Georgia  
A rainy night in Georgia  
I believe, that it's rainin' all over the world  
I feel, that it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'  
Taxi cabs, and buses passin' through the night  
The distant moanin' of the train  
Seems to play a sad refrain, to the night  

A rainy night in Georgia  
Such a rainy night in Georgia  
I believe, that it's rainin' all over the world  
I feel, that it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered  
It still comes out the same  
No matter how you look at it or think of it  
It's life, and we've just got to play the game  

I shake the rain from my sweater  
Take out your letters, to pass some time  
Late at night when it's hard to rest  
I hold your picture to my breast  
And I feel fine  

It's a rainy night in Georgia  
Such a rainy night in Georgia  
I feel, that it's rainin' all over the world  
Lord I feel, that it's rainin' all over the world
