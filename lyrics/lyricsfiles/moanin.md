# Moanin
Every Mornin' finds me moanin'  
I'm alone and crying the blues  
I'm so tired of paying the dues  
Ev'ry body knows I'm moanin'  

Every evening I am moanin'  
Cuz of all I the trouble I see  
Life's a loosing gamble to me  
Ev'ry body knows I moanin'  

Lord I spend many a days and nights alone with my grief  
and I pray, really and truly pray  
somebody will come and bring me relief.  

Every mornin' finds me moanin'  
I'm alone and crying the blues  
I'm so tired of paying my dues  
Ev'ry body knows I'm moanin'
