<h2>Jazz Singing Workshops</h2>

<p>This February, I will be holding two jazz singing workshops at the <a href="http://vicparkarts.com.au" target="_blank">Victoria Park Centre for the Arts</a>, 12 Kent St, East Victoria Park WA 6101:</p>

<p><strong>Jazz Vocal Ensemble ($15)<br />
6:30 pm 7th February</strong><br />
In the <em>Jazz Vocal Ensemble</em> workshop, we will partake in jazz group singing improvisation activities to aquaint ourselves with the unique sound and feel of jazz music. We will then use these skills to sing a repertoire of a capella blues, jazz and gospel numbers.<p>

<p><strong>8th Feb 2017 - Solo Jazz Singing ($15)<br />
6:30 pm 8th February</strong><br />
In the <em>Solo Jazz singing</em> workshop, we will unleash your inner Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald. We will cover performance aspects which are essential to a solo jazz singer, from advanced vocal technique to how to work with a jazz band (please prepare 1-2 jazz standards to perform in class, preferably from <a href="https://didijazz.github.io/blog/2016/11/15/jazz-singer-standards">this list</a>).</p>
