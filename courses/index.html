<h2>Jazz Singing Workshops</h2>

<p>This February, I will be holding two jazz singing workshops at the <a href="http://vicparkarts.com.au" target="_blank">Victoria Park Centre for the Arts</a>:</p>

<p><strong>7th Feb 2017 - Jazz Vocal Ensemble ($15)</strong><br />
In the Jazz Vocal Ensemble Workshop, we will partake in jazz group singing improvisation activities to aquaint ourselves with the unique sound and feel of jazz music. We will then use these skills to sing a repertoire of a capella blues, jazz and gospel numbers. [ register ]<p>

<p><strong>8th Feb 2017 - Solo Jazz Singing ($15)</strong><br />
In the Solo Jazz singing Workshop, you will unleash your inner Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald. We will cover issues relevant to a solo jazz singer performing with live instrumentalists, from advanced vocal technique to how to work with a jazz band (please prepare 1-2 jazz standards to perform in class, preferably from this list).
