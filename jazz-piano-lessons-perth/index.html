<p><em><strong>Update February 2020:</strong> Due to personal reasons, I am downscaling my teaching, and will no longer be taking on new students for the foreseeable future. As such, links to this 'Lessons' page on this website has been removed, and I have also removed myself from music teaching directories. If you spotted a music teaching listing that I missed, please e-mail me so I can remove it!</p>

<p>I offer personalized jazz piano lessons, bass lessons and singing lessons from my studio in Perth, Australia. Come and have a listen to my <a href="/audio/index.html">recordings</a> or check out my <a href="/about/index.html">musical background</a> to have an idea of what I teach. If you are then interested in lessons, please contact me on <a href="mailto:lessons@didi.com.au" target="_blank">lessons@didi.com.au</a> or (08) 6102 0525.</p>

<p>As a full-time musician who has performed live and toured Australia, Japan, China and Southeast Asia since the 90s, my teaching includes real-life practical performance skills learnt from the school of hard gigs. A graduate of the <a href="http://music.sydney.edu.au/" target="_blank">Sydney Conservatorium</a>, I can also provide you with a pedagocically sound foundation in jazz/pop harmony and improvisational skills.</p>

<p>(Bonus: as a trained multi-instrumentalist, I can be your sparring partner as well as teacher, whether you study piano, bass or vocals.)</p>
