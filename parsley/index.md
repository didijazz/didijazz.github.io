## Parsley Patch

### August 2018
Took it in a coffee cup from the outside of a local vege garden (that garden was so fertile, parsley was starting to grow outside on their sidewalk).

### March 2019
It grew to a decent size, but the summer eventually killed it.

### July 2019
However, it did leave some offspring.

## Coriander Patch

### July 2019
Grew them from seed a few months earlier, by the driveway.

### August 2019
Within a month it grew quite fast.

### September 2019
One more month, we had enough coriander for several households.

### November 2019
They were starting to die, the plants matured, and summer's coming.

### May 2020
The next generation of corieander didn't grow so high, I'm guessing because I didn't bother thinning it, just let the seeds grow where they fell (which was everywhere). Whereas the original seeds were carefully spaced out. Recently I transplanted some of these to the backyard with proper spacing near the parsley. Hopefully in time they'll grow as tall as their parents.
