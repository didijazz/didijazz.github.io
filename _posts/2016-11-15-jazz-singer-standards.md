There are many lists of jazz standards floating around the internet, all of them are a good guide on what jazz standards one needs to know as a jazz musician. One of my favourite lists is the one at [jazzstandards.com](http://www.jazzstandards.com/compositions/) because:

* It is quite extensive, 1,000 jazz standards!
* They are ranked according to a [particular methodology](http://www.jazzstandards.com/overview.ranking.htm), so you get an idea of which are the most popular jazz standards recorded (and thus to learn)
* The top 300 jazz standards each have a page of their own, with information on composers, published key, popular jazz recorded versions etc. Quite a useful resource for anyone studying the jazz standards.

For jazz singers, I have put together a subjective sub-list of this jazzstandards.com list, whittling it down to 250 songs. These 250 songs reflect my personal biases of which songs I have in my record collection, have performed most often, and therefore know more intimately than the rest. Also, I have chosen the songs which are more relevant to jazz singers, excluding instrumental tunes written by jazz musicians (Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins et. al.) which were not originally written with lyrics.

Jazz singers and their accompanists, I hope you find this sublist useful! (If you are an instrumentalist, here is a good article recommending the "[100 Must Know Jazz Tunes](http://www.hopestreetmusicstudios.com/articles/100-must-know-jazz-tunes)".)
