A big thank you to all who attended January's inaugural 2017 Jazz Singing Workshop! After considering the post-workshop feedback, this February I will be holding two jazz singing workshops at the [Victoria Park Centre for the Arts](http://vicparkarts.org.au) (12 Kent St, East Victoria Park WA 6101) for group singers and solo singers:

**Jazz Vocal Ensemble ($15)  
6:30 pm - 8:30 pm, 7th February**  
In the *Jazz Vocal Ensemble* workshop, we will partake in jazz group singing improvisation activities to acquaint ourselves with the unique sound and feel of jazz music. We will then use these skills to sing a repertoire of a capella blues, jazz and gospel numbers.  
*Drop in class, registration not required*

**Solo Jazz Singing ($15)  
6:30 pm - 8:30 pm, 8th February**  
In the *Solo Jazz Singing* workshop, we will unleash your inner Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald. We will cover performance aspects which are essential to a solo jazz singer, from advanced vocal technique to how to work with a jazz band (please prepare 1-2 jazz standards to perform in class, preferably from [this list](https://didijazz.github.io/blog/2016/11/15/jazz-singer-standards)).  
*Regsitration required, please [click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFM7_xE4w-VRSI2rTcH1RMYAEPJjbe2G82E3ffazigkGAo4w/viewform).*

Hope to see you there!
