<h3><a id="Early_Years_14"></a>Early Years</h3>
<p>My parents parents arrived in Australia from Indonesia in the 1960's as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo_Plan#Programmes" target="_blank">Colombo Plan</a> scholarship programme. Born in Melbourne to a musical family, my father taught me three-chord ukulele songs when I was seven. I had a wandering childhood, living in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Malaysia before the age of 12. After starting my first 'jazz band' in Jakarta, I eventually made my way to back to Australia.</p>
<h3><a id="Sydney_Start_18"></a>Sydney Start</h3>
<p>Soon after graduating from the <a href="http://music.sydney.edu.au/" target="_blank">Sydney Conservatorium</a>, I was a jazz piano accompanist at the <a href="">Sydney Four Seasons</a> from 2000 to 2005. In this post, I played with and learned from Sydney's top bassplayers and music educators <a href="http://www.craigscott.com.au/" target="_blank">Craig Scott</a> (ex. Joe Henderson, Lee Konitz, Nat Adderly) and <a href="http://www.aim.edu.au/teachers/gary-holgate" target="_blank" target="_blank">Gary Holgate</a> (ex. Randy Brecker, Mark Murphy, Annie Ross), accompanying the likes of <a href="http://www.greggarthur.com/">Gregg Arthur</a> and <a href="http://www.katrinaretallick.com/" target="_blank">Katrina Rettalick</a>. In the education field, I accompanied teachers and students of workshops and masterclasses held at the Sydney Conservatorium by leading jazz vocal educators <a href="http://pamelaknowles.com/" target="_blank">Pamela Knowles</a>, <a href="http://www.joyyates-davemacrae.com/" target="_blank">Joy Yates</a>, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nicky-crayson" target="_blank">Nicky Crayson</a>.</p>
<p>Working primarily as a singer accompanist, I eventually developed an interest in singing myself, and studied jazz vocals under <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/kerrie-biddell-the-first-lady-of-australian-jazz-20140909-10eaff.html" target="_blank">Kerrie Biddell</a>. I also took part in workshops and masterclasses by US jazz vocalists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Carter" target="_blank">Betty Carter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Murphy_%28singer%29" target="_blank">Mark Murphy</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Elling" target="_blank">Kurt Elling</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="Adventures_in_Asia_24"></a>Adventures in Asia</h3>
<p>In 2005, I left Australia for China as part of <a href="http://www.nikkidoll.com/" target="_blank">Nikki Doll and The Voodoo Blue</a> for a 6-month engagement in Shanghai and Beijing. Nikki and the rest of The Voodoo Blue returned to Sydney after this engagement, but I stayed on and continued over a decade of touring the Asia-Pacific region as a <a href="pressposters.html">piano-vocalist</a>. A highlight of my Asian travels was performing at the 2007 <a href="http://sapporocityjazz.jp/" target="_blank">Sapporo Jazz Festival</a> in Japan with <a href="http://davegoodman.com.au/" target="_blank">Dave Goodman</a> (drums) and Kyo Kitagaki (bass). While abroad, I continued to put my jazz piano accompaniment skills to good use, backing ex. Motown singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Taylor_%26_the_Vancouvers" target="_blank">Bobby Taylor</a> in Beijing, Shanghai jazz singer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jasminechenmusic/" target="_blank">Jasmine Chen</a> and Indonesian jazz singer <a href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherly_O" target="_blank">Sherly O</a>.</p>

<p>Returning to Sydney in 2009, I met the wonderful Singaporean jazz singer-songwriter <a href="http://julietpang.net" target="_blank">Juliet Pang</a> at a jazz open mic. We formed the popular ukulele duo <a href="http://facebook.com/apugnosedream" target="_blank">Polkadot + Moonbeam</a> and piano duo <a href="http://facebook.com/wearemint" target="_blank">Mint Street</a>, and were based from 2011 in Singapore, from which we toured Australia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Juliet and I married in Singapore in 2013, and in 2016 settled in Perth Australia as music educators, sharing our extensive music performance experience.</p>
